Used Armature Voltage Control Method to control speed of PM-DC motor, and verified the same usinga DSO.Created and implemented the circuit on breadboard used BJT(2N2222) and Free-Wheeling Diode(DN4007).Used NE555P timer to generate square pulses, modulated using potentiometer, varying the speed from 50% to 100%.
