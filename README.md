# Controlling-speed-of-a-DC-motor-using-Armature-Voltage-Control-Method
Used Armature Voltage Control Method to control speed of PM-DC motor, and verified the same using a DSO.Created and implemented the circuit on breadboard used BJT(2N2222) and Free-Wheeling Diode(DN4007).Used NE555P timer to generate square pulses, modulated using potentiometer, varying the speed from 50% to 100%.
